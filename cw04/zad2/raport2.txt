Ignore:
    Both child processes ignore signal sent by the parent process. 
    Ignoring signals are inherited.

Handle:
    The forked process has the same handler as the parent one.
    Exec process terminates upon receiving a signal, as it hasn't got any handler.
    Handle is partially inherited.

Mask:
    Both child processes block signals sent by the parent process.
    Masks are inherited.

Pending:
    Both child processes do not see parent masked signal.
    Pending is not inherited.
